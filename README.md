I specialize in building Applications, Websites and everything in between.  <br />


Using technology to solve problems in the real world is something I'm passionate about.  While I have experience building software in C / C++ and Javascript, Python is my go-to language to solve most of the challenges I face. <br />

Developing software for the past six years, Most of my projects are independent and developed as a passion for programming. what drives me is my ability to quickly adapt to innovative tech and apply it to my productivity apps enhancing my day-to-day experience as well as people around me.
