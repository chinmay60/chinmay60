## :scroll: Summary
I specialize in building Applications, Websites and everything in between.  <br />


Using technology to solve problems in the real world is something I'm passionate about.  While I have experience building software in C / C++ and Javascript, Python is my go-to language to solve most of the challenges I face. <br />

Developing software for the past six years, Most of my projects are independent and developed as a passion for programming. what drives me is my ability to quickly adapt to innovative tech and apply it to my productivity apps enhancing my day-to-day experience as well as people around me.

## 🎲️ My journey
I designed my first app in 7th grade, a basic calculator written in C++. I have always been fascinated by how programming could solve my problems and help others. As I learned more, I taught myself Python and started creating utility applications that can be used by anyone. After falling in love with programming in the school itself, career in software development was a given. I graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering in Information Technology and wanted to learn more.

## 🎓️ University of Cincinnati
Pursuing Masters in Computer Science at the University of Cincinnati, I dived deep into Advanced Algorithms and Parallel Computing. Subsequently, I taught myself React and Redux and learned my way around designing APIs and databases for large-scale systems.

I am thrilled to continue expanding my skill-set I developed at UC.
